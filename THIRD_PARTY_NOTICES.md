## MediaPipe Tasks Vision 0.10.21 and fixed vision models (bundled, Apache-2.0)

Copyright Google LLC and MediaPipe contributors. Unmodified runtime assets are
included in `vendor/vision/`: `vision_bundle.mjs`, SIMD/no-SIMD WASM loaders and
binaries. The full upstream Apache License 2.0, including its existing notices,
is retained in `vendor/vision/LICENSE.txt`.

Bundled, unmodified model weights:

- BlazeFace short-range float16 version 1 (`blaze_face_short_range-v1.tflite`).
- MediaPipe Selfie Segmenter float16 version 1 (`selfie_segmenter-v1.tflite`).

The model cards identify Apache License 2.0. Original download URLs, exact sizes
and SHA-256 are recorded in `vendor/vision/manifest.json`. Our frame processing,
tiling, tracking and coarse-grid conversion are separate application code; the
models/runtime have not been modified. Preserve these assets and notices when
redistributing a package. Models are loaded lazily from this package, not a CDN.
