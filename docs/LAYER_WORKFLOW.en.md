# User guide — JIZURA Layer Studio

This is the short workflow for v1.5.0. See the [detailed user manual](../user_guide.en.md) for retained JIZURA features, including fonts, colors, techniques, locks and individual cut editing.

[日本語](LAYER_WORKFLOW.md) · [README](../README.en.md)

## Subtitles and preview

On desktop, the whole center pane scrolls vertically with a permanent scrollbar. Card changes preserve preview size and the scroll offset from the pane top. Detailed technique choices expand downward; scroll the center pane to choose them. The wheel over the timeline zooms it. Mobile mode retains page scrolling.

Import a UTF-8 SRT as an editable starting point. Start/end times, line breaks, gaps and overlaps are loaded initially; the source SRT file is never modified. Characters like `/`, `*`, `|`, `!` are literal in SRT.

Click the timeline band to seek. Drag an upper row-start handle or type a start time in the line list to retime a cue. Tap sync is available only without SRT. Its end moves by the same amount, preserving duration. Per-line effect settings follow cues when their time order changes.

Use “Edit SRT text, start and end” to edit text or times; changing only the end changes duration. The row edit button or a double-click on its text opens this editor too. Undo / Ctrl+Z restores edits, and project JSON preserves them when saved and reopened.

Use Add subtitle at start, Add after and Delete in the SRT editor to add/remove normal cues; Ctrl+Z undoes changes. Empty text keeps a silent slot. Ideographic spaces are valid text; ASCII spaces separate groups. Invalid times block export until corrected.

Without SRT, type subtitles using the original lyric syntax. Auto-compose, adjust individual rows, or return to a previous proposal. Effect panels, ribbons, graphics, HUDs and flashes can cover the full frame. Plain base backgrounds and independent title/interlude scenes are excluded.

Load an image/video as a preview background. Songs support preview and timing. Neither background nor audio is included in pair exports.

## Themes and cue draws

Themes are No theme, Lyric video, Kinetic, Japanese, Horror, Pop, Ballad and saved user themes. Selecting alone leaves the composition unchanged. Global Auto-compose enables necessary sets globally. Cue keys 1–3 consider the theme and enable its required sets only inside that cue. Keys 4/6 use the applied cue base; 9 restores the last global settings and theme; 0/5/7 ignore the pending theme. See [draw scopes](../user_guide.en.md#automatic-parts-and-subtitle-rerolls).

User themes… assigns style and mood weights from 0–10. Hover/tap names for explanations. From mood uses the chosen mood's style distribution. Use mood distribution approximates style weights and replaces mood weights with 1 for the chosen mood and 0 for all others. Save, select the theme and use Auto-compose or cue key 1 to apply it. Manage the shared collection through the dialog or dedicated JSON. Applied settings remain independent of theme edits, deletion or reuse of the same name. See [user themes](../user_guide.en.md#creating-and-transferring-user-themes).

Global change controls offer Fonts consistent with the style/mood, Palette changes including the main color while preserving light/dark and saturation structure, and the original Palette fine-tune. Cue key 7 changes only that cue's fonts independently of style/mood; key 5 changes only its colors.

Undo / Ctrl+Z follows the order of cue edits and global changes. Previous/next proposal buttons navigate composition proposals. Media, export settings and shared-library actions are outside cue-edit Undo.

Hide decorative numbers and times under Subtitle layers removes numeric ornaments while preserving lyric numbers and `[timestamp]`, without rerolling effects.

## Motion library

Open Motion library… beside Auto-compose. No library item is initially selected; the current cue automatically auditions if it has savable generation settings. Save motion adds it to the collection. Leave the name blank for an automatic motion001-style name. Legacy cues without generation settings cannot be saved.

Select an item to audition it with the current lyrics, then Apply to replace that cue's motion. With no cue selected, the preview uses compatible sample text. Incompatible lyrics, such as too few characters for a layout, block application. Auditions are silent with a patterned background and exclude media and titles.

Rename, delete and export/import the collection as dedicated JSON. Applied cues carry independent setting copies and are unaffected by library edits or deletion. Project JSON does not contain the whole shared motion library; use dedicated JSON to transfer or back up the collection. See [stored settings, adaptation and duplicate IDs](../user_guide.en.md#motion-library).

## Filler subtitles

Timeline numbers are gray for normal cues and red for fillers. Both become yellow while hovered or dragged. Updated defaults apply to new settings; saved filler settings are preserved.

After importing SRT, **Add fillers…** opens a settings dialog. Generated cues are editable placeholders, marked as fillers independently of their text. Regeneration replaces all fillers, including manually edited ones, while preserving normal subtitles and effects. **Remove all fillers** is also available. Generation and removal support Ctrl+Z.

- **Usable gap threshold:** applied after the pre-gap following a normal cue and the post-gap before the next. Defaults are 5s threshold, 0.3s pre-gap and 0.5s post-gap: an interior gap must be at least 5.8s. Intros use only the post-gap; outros use only the pre-gap. Overlapping normal cues form one occupied interval.
- **Average duration:** Normal is the mean of the longer half of current normal cue durations, rounding the count up. Short uses ×0.75 and Long ×1.5. Individual durations vary while filling each eligible interval.
- **Text types:** enable Whitespace, Lyric text, Timestamp, Symbols and/or Custom text. Weights range from 0–10. Defaults enable all types at weights 3, 8, 2, 1 and 0. Custom text starts empty and uses the full text entered. If enabled with a positive weight but no text, generation reports an error without replacing existing fillers. Whitespace uses 3–4 groups of 2–5 ideographic spaces separated by ASCII spaces, allowing plates and decorations without visible lyric glyphs. Symbols follow the mean normal text length excluding whitespace, using repeated, mixed, alternating or symmetric patterns. Lyrics are chosen whole from normal cues regardless of length.
- **Time tags:** `[timestamp]` renders as `02 05 853` using the cue start time and follows retiming. Type it into normal or filler cues, alone or with other text. The editor and JSON retain the literal tag.
- **End time:** uses audio duration first, then spectrum duration, otherwise the last normal cue; never shorter than the last normal cue. Load media first to fill the outro.

Existing fillers are excluded from all gap and reference calculations. Settings and filler identity persist in JSON. Cancel leaves the project unchanged. Safeguards: target duration is at least 0.25s, symbols at most 120 characters, and total cues at most 20,000.

## Spectrum

Choose None, Generate from audio or External video under Spectrum source. Load a song and select Generate from audio for 64 bars with sensitivity, pulse strength, return time and top/bottom color controls. The gradient is fixed to the maximum height, so short bars show only lower colors. Preview, seeking and MP4 export share the analyzed motion. Placement is shared with external footage; file-import instructions below apply to External video. See [Built-in spectrum](../user_guide.en.md#generating-from-audio).

[Audio Spectrum Overlay Maker](https://github.com/cityedge/audio-spectrum-overlay-maker) is a tool developed by cityedge for creating spectrum videos to import into this app.

Import a front video to composite automatically; clear the front to stop compositing. There is no compositing checkbox. Its matte is optional. Select both together to match `speana_sample.mp4` with `speana_sample_matte_dark.mp4`. The app cannot discover unselected sibling files and has no folder picker.

- Without a matte, exactly RGB 000000 after placement/scaling is transparent. Near-black values and compression noise remain.
- With a matte, size/duration must match. Mean matte RGB below 128 is opaque, while RGB-zero front pixels remain transparent. Use nonzero black in external artwork to retain it.
- Add/clear the matte to switch modes. Bloom cleanup does not apply to spectrum media.
- Both start at zero, subtitles in front; media is empty after its end.
- Default: 65% frame width, preserved source aspect, 3% left/bottom margins. Independent scales use the base as 100%. Settings persist in JSON; preview/export share placement. Outside-frame content is clipped.

## FPS and spectrum frames

New projects default to 30fps. Subtitle cadence options are 15 drawings/s (on twos), 10 drawings/s (on threes), and full output fps. Auto-compose uses these cadences. Saved 24fps and legacy 12/8 drawings/s settings are preserved; select 30fps explicitly when updating an existing project. Real-time effect durations and fade speeds are retained.

Export decodes spectrum frames through WebCodecs and selects them by presentation timestamp (PTS), independently of preview playback. A constant 30fps source exported at 30fps from a source frame boundary uses every source frame once, in order. This is frame correspondence, not pixel-identical output: scaling, compositing and lossy MP4 encoding still change pixels.

Front and matte are sampled at the same output times; source files must already be synchronized. 29.97fps, variable-frame-rate and mismatched rates require timestamp-based frame holds or drops. Subtitle cadence does not affect spectrum frames. 24fps and 60fps output remain available.

Supported containers: MP4, MOV, WebM, Matroska and Ogg; codec support depends on the browser. If exact decoding is unavailable, export reports an error rather than silently falling back to video-element seeking. Editing previews still use video elements.

## Exterior bloom cleanup

All added exterior bloom is removed regardless of brightness. There is no control; old project thresholds are ignored and discarded. Preview and both MP4 export paths share this behavior.

Only new exterior pixels added by automatic bloom / bloom effects are removed. Original text, graphics, sparks and interior brightness changes remain. Not every dark shadow or camera blur is removed.

## Opacity modes

Opacity mode under Subtitle layers controls preview and all exports. Binary (legacy) retains the previous result; Alpha (grayscale matte) preserves partial opacity. Projects save this setting; older JSON defaults to binary. Spectra remain binary, with translucent subtitles composited over them. Exterior bloom removal remains active.

Alpha pairs use `_alpha` filenames. Their front contains premultiplied RGB (color multiplied by opacity). The grayscale matte is white for transparent, black for opaque. Multiply the background by the matte, then add the front: `result = front + background * (matte / 255)`. Do not threshold it, use Darken/Lighten, or multiply the front by alpha again. Front-only output cannot preserve opacity by itself. Simple video composites retained opacity directly onto its background. MP4 compression can alter colors and matte edges.

In Alpha mode, Background color opacity ranges from 0–100% (default 40%). It affects rendering and mixtures that use the palette background color, not other palette fields, fixed colors or spectrum opacity. It applies to all previews/exports and persists in JSON.

## Output

Preview with background + subtitles, front on black, or binary/grayscale matte. Use a background to inspect dark artwork.

Export two direct MP4s without ZIP compression. Allow multiple downloads if prompted, or use individual save links. Keep the tab open during export.

Names: `project_subtitle_front.mp4` and `project_subtitle_front_matte_dark.mp4`. Spectrum composites use `combined_front`. Alpha mode appends `_alpha` to the front name; its matching matte adds `_matte_dark` after that. Both files have matching dimensions, fps and frame count, without audio.

16:9 presets: 854×480, 960×540, 1280×720, 1360×766, 1600×900, 1920×1080, 2560×1440, 3840×2160. Other aspect ratios change dimensions; both axes are even. The intermediate option displays actual dimensions (766×1360 for portrait).

## Black, matte and compositing

RGB 000000 means empty space. Black subtitle drawing colours become RGB 030303 before alpha is applied. Fades rounded down to zero stay empty.

In Binary mode, exactly the nonblack final front pixels produce black matte pixels before encoding; empty pixels produce white. No outline dilation or partial alpha is exported in this mode. Soft effects retain brightness on black, which can create a dark edge over bright footage. Alpha mode uses the continuous matte described above.

Lossy MP4 compression/colour conversion may change exact RGB and introduce intermediate matte shades. Verify decoded footage in your compositor.

For Binary mode, apply the matte with Darken, then the front with Lighten. Match timing, size and speed. For custom alpha processing use `alpha = 1 - matte / 255`. The pre-encode binary pair also obeys `front + background * (matte / 255)`. For Alpha mode, use Multiply then Add as described above; the front is already premultiplied.

### Difference instead of Add

If Add is unavailable but absolute Difference is available, stack these from back to front:

1. Background: Normal
2. Grayscale matte: Multiply
3. Full-frame white: Difference
4. Matching Alpha-mode front: Difference
5. Full-frame white: Difference

Set every layer to 100% opacity and cover the same frame and interval with both white layers. This equals Add when background × matte + front is at most 1 in each RGB channel, as with a correct ordinary premultiplied pair. Verify a short range for color-processing/compression differences. See the [full procedure and calculation](../user_guide.en.md#when-add-is-unavailable-but-difference-is-available).

## Choosing fonts

Detailed font addition and simple-video title settings can list installed PC fonts in supported browsers after permission. Existing choices and font-name entry remain available when listing is unsupported or denied. Font files themselves are not saved; install the same fonts on another PC to use them there. See [installed fonts](../user_guide.en.md#installed-pc-fonts).

## Save and limitations

Save project JSON explicitly; autosave is a convenience. Subtitles, effects and placement persist, but actual background, spectrum and song files do not. Reselect media after reopening JSON; cues and fillers are already restored, so do not reimport SRT. Save before language switching, which reloads the page.

Reset project clears current subtitles, effects, media and history while retaining shared user themes, the motion library and interface preferences. Delete shared items in their management dialogs; back them up as dedicated JSON first.

Desktop Chrome / Edge is recommended. MP4 requires WebCodecs and H.264 encoding, depending on browser/OS. Long/4K exports are not thoroughly verified and use substantial memory; start with a short range. File-URL storage behavior depends on browser.

PNG and AE export are not offered. The interface supports Japanese and English; subtitle text languages and font support are preserved.

## Simple video export (optional)

Simple video settings… contains duration, Exclude audio and title controls. Titles support font, bold/italic, size in 0.5% steps, color, outline, position, translucent black backing, whole-video or start/end timing, and one-second in/out fades. Title text is in front; its backing is directly above the background. Inspect the composite with the dialog time slider. Settings persist in JSON and do not affect layer exports.

The neutral-colored Export simple video MP4 button below the pair description saves a single composite, back to front: image/video background, title backing, spectrum, subtitles, title text. Disabling the title removes both its text and backing. No background means black. Video backgrounds start at timeline zero and hold their final frame after ending. Both generated and external spectra can be used. Background audio is ignored.

Duration automatically follows the longest subtitle, spectrum, decoded audio or video background when materials are loaded or changed, and remains manually editable. Background duration uses the video track's end time. Audio counts even with Exclude audio checked. Extending output holds the background, hides ended overlays and adds silence after the song.

Background frames are decoded and selected by output timestamps. Constant 30fps footage exported at 30fps from a frame boundary uses every source frame in order; other rates involve holds or drops. Range exports keep the original source timestamps. Unsupported codecs report a reason and block simple export.

Existing resolution, fps, quality and range settings apply; duration rounds up to whole video frames. Audio is encoded as AAC at its original level, independent of preview volume. If AAC encoding is unavailable, exclude audio or use a supported environment. Settings persist in JSON. See [details](../user_guide.en.md#exporting-a-simple-video).
